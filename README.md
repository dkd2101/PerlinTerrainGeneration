* Name and partners name(At most teams of 2 folks total)
  * Team member 1: *Linwood Blaisdell*
  * Team member 2: *Dylan Dinio*
* How many hours did it take you to complete this final project?
  * ~30 hours
* Did you collaborate or share ideas with any other students/TAs/Professors?
  * No
* Did you use any external resources? 
* Note it is fair to utilize some tutorials--cite them here. You **must** add your own personal touch however!
  * [Article](https://gpfault.net/posts/perlin-noise.txt.html) explaining the math and implementation examples of [Perlin Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) creation.
  * [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikwNrFvnL3g&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZV4yEcW3uDwOgGXKUUsPOM&index=7) explaining what Perlin noise is and but with Processing.
  * A different [article](https://rtouti.github.io/graphics/perlin-noise-algorithm) explaining 2D Perlin noise and Fractal Brownian motion 
  * [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAgy8rcZyZU&list=PLA0dXqQjCx0S9qG5dWLsheiCJV-_eLUM0&index=6) explaining height based texture generation.
  * [Learn OpenGl lesson on Cameras](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Camera)
  * (Optional) What was the most interesting part of the Final Assignment? How could the instructor improve the final project?
    * This allowed me to explore an algorithm thatis very useful in games in general as perlin noise has applications outside of just terrain generation as it can be used for graphing or other random generation that requires values within close distance of each other.
    * It was a difficult task to be able to understand the perlin algorithm in order to implement it in code and figuring out how to take the image and connect it to the terrain proved difficult.
